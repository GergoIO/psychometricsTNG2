#' Function to detect and determine grading schemes .
#' 
#' @description Function to detect and determine grading schemes. fnSchemeDetect returns the scheme that has been determined from the data (SchemeDetect$Scheme), as well as a standardised data set (SchemeDetect$Data).
#' 
#' Can currently be used with: UBSE, USE, CIDK, CNINC, CNINC, CNINC, PF, PFE, UBLHE, Gender, Disability, Letters, Ethnicity
#' 
#' @note 
#' (DZ070917) Can't yet handle if two schemes account for the same amount of values; all possibles listed and warning displayed. First possible used to standardise the data.
#' (DZ070917) Doesn't check for values not in Table.Schemes; so rogue values in Data cause an error.
#' (DZ070917) Doesn't check scheme specified in Force.Scheme exists in Table.Schemes. Need check/warning for this. 
#' 
#' @usage fnSchemeDetect(Data, Force.Scheme)
#' 
#' @param Data Data vector to from which to determine a Scheme.
#' @param Force.Scheme Optional. Used to specify or force a Scheme.

# NOTES:

# fnSchemeDetect returns the scheme that has been determined from the data (SchemeDetect$Scheme), as well as a standardised data set (SchemeDetect$Data) 

# Can't yet handle if two schemes account for the same amount of values; all possibles listed and warning displayed. First possible used to standardis the data.

# Doesn't check for values not in Table.Schemes; so rogue values in Data cause an error.

# Doesn't check scheme specified in Force.Scheme exists in Table.Schemes. Need check/warning for this.
